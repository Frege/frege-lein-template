# frege-lein-template

A Leiningen template for creating new (mixed language) Clojure / Frege projects.

## Usage

    lein frege myapp

This will create a folder called `myapp` containing the skeleton of a Frege project with a Clojure main and tests. See the generated `README.md` for details of how to run the test, how to run the Clojure / Frege project, and how to run the Frege code as a standalone app.
